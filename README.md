OpenGLFun
=========

Multiple Projects messing around with OpenGL and some XBox Kinect Stuff


KinectCenterDepth was a test project to make sure all the kinect libraries are installed correctly.
Same thing with KinectTestProject

OpenCV takes the IR image from the kinect and finds the visual targets used in each FRC game

OpenGL3TimesTheCharm displays the kinect data visually in a 3D FPS view

OpenGL_BasicGUI is our HUD for next year. Many plans and updates for this.

UltrasonicPositioning is my visual display of our ultrasonic positioning software.
